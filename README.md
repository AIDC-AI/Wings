## Why Wings?

üí° TL;DR

- Wings is a brand-new universal Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Its flexible multimodal structure enhances the MLLM as if **giving it wings that enhance the performance of multimodal capabilities** while minimizing text-only forgetting.

- **Any** architecture of MLLM can adapt the Wings component.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), initiated with a trained LLM, first align images with text and then fine-tune on multimodal mixed inputs. However, the MLLM **catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions**, which do not include images and can be addressed within the initial LLM.

In this work, we present Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only dialogues and multimodal comprehension. Analyzing MLLM attention in multimodal instructions reveals that **text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text.** From that, we construct extra modules that act as the boosted learner to compensate for the attention shift. The complementary visual and textual learners, **like "wings" on either side, are connected in parallel within each layer's attention block.** Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Textual learners are later collaboratively integrated with attention-based routing to blend the outputs of the visual and textual learners. We design the **Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA)** to guarantee high efficiency for learners.

Our experimental results demonstrate that Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks. On a newly constructed Interleaved Image-Text (IIT) benchmark, Wings exhibits superior performance from text-only-rich to multimodal-rich question-answering tasks.
